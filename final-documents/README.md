# Rebooting the Web of Trust X (Spring 2019) Virtual Papers

_Though we were unable to have a design workshop, some planned participants produced collaborative papers virtually_.

## [*Quantum Secure DIDs*](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot10-buenosaires/blob/master/final-documents/quantum-secure-dids.pdf) [(Text)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot10-buenosaires/blob/master/final-documents/quantum-secure-dids.md)

> The cyberworld in which we spend our days — and upon which our lives depend — is built on weak security guarantees at the atomic level of the informational stack, and it is becoming more and more justified to question their longevity as building blocks. From nation-states trying to sway elections with fake news to ransomware that shuts down hospitals, we are living in a "Wild West" in which seemingly any data, or any transaction, may be compromised if interested parties devote enough resources to the attack. And like travellers in a lawless frontier, we are left to scan the horizon constantly for trouble, scrambling to plug the leaks in defences we cannot trust completely.

> The objective of this paper is to describe a mechanism for protecting DIDs using existing ciphers for signing during the transition phase to a fully quantum-secure decentralised identity infrastructure. This mechanism is designed to support DIDs but its core mechanisms are identifier-independent and DID:method-independent. Analysis of secure key-management solutions for multiple keys and quantum-resistant ciphers for signing are beyond the scope of this paper and assumed to progress in parallel. This paper describes a quantum-resistant architecture for today's non-quantum-resistant ciphers*, intended to be retrofitted to existing systems.
